THIS IS THE "ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS" GAME, A PROJECT FOR THE ODIN PROJECT

* PHASE 1 *

SIMPLE A CONSOLE PROGRAM WITHOUT THE INTERFACE
THE IDEA IN MIND IS TO SIMPLY PRINT THE OUTPUT TO THE CONSOLE PROGRAM IN THE CHROME DEV TOOLS

*THE GAME*

step 1

THE GAME STARTS WITH OPTION TO LET THE PLAYER PICK A CHOICE OF WEAPON FOR THE GAME OUT OF THE OPTIONS "rock, paper, and scissors" AND COMPARES IT TO THE CHOICE ON THE COMPUTER'S SIDE WHICH IT RANDOMLY CHOSE AND PRINTING A THE SCORE FOR THE PLAYER AND THE COMPUTER ALONG WITH THE MESSAGE FOR THE OUTCOME OF A SINGLE ROUND.
    -userInput = prompt(choice);
    -computerinput = Math.floor(Math.random()*3+1);
    -then match the random numbers(1,2,3) to the (rock, paper, scissors)
    -logic for the game + score + the outcome for a single round

step 2

THE GAME IS A TOTAL OF FIVE ROUNDS. THE GAME GOES ON UNTIL A TOTAL NUMBER OF FIVE ROUNDS IS REACHED AND FINALLY CLOSING WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE WHOLE GAME + THE TOTAL SCORE
    -create a loop for five rounds and call the playRound function five times
    -print out a message for the final outcome with the total score of the game
